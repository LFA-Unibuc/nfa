# nfa

#### Exercise 1.
Implement a library/program in a programming language of your
choosing that creates a NFA and then check of DFA accepts a give string.
Use your library from lab 1 to generate the NFA based on input file.
Use two implementations

#### Hints for implemetations: 
- Convert the NFA to a DFA and solve it using lab 2
- Use a non-deterministic approach
- Use backtracking
- Design another algorithm (bonus 2/10 points)

#### Allow command line arguments to your program in the form:
nfa.py nfa_config_file implementation_1/implementation_2 input_string

#### Exercise 2
Create configuration files for NFAs from Exercises 1.7 (Sipser -
Chapter 1).
